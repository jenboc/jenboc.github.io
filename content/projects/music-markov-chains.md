This project was undertaken for three reasons
1. I wanted to undertake a substantial project in Haskell
2. I wanted to mess around with Markov Chains and look at more traditional machine learning techniques
3. I wanted to outdo my NEA (see [Apollo](/projects/apollo))

It comes with a frontend written in React, and chatgpt assisted styling (since I am far from a designer) for the people who do not want to mess with the wonders of Haskell. For others, the important part of the project is built as a library and so you can mess with this how you wish.

At this point in time, the project is in a bit of a mess: there is no documentation at present, and it would be nice to separate the library into a different repository (so I apologise) but that is something I will get around to at some point (hopefully ;))
