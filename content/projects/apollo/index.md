Apollo is a music generator relying on LSTM cells, it is currently written in 
C# and uses no libraries. It was my submission for my A Level Computer Science 
NEA (non-examined assessment) which, for the uninitiated, is a substantial 
project undertaken separately from the exam papers and requires students to 
choose a problem, analyse it, plan their solution then implement and test it 
thoroughly. 

I chose to undertake a music generation problem using neural networks so that 
I could learn more about the mathematics behind deep learning and numerical 
computing. The final result was, in my opinion, underwhelming, the GUI didn't 
feel very intuitive, and the program was very slow. This can be attributed to 
a few things, and may be corrected if and when I revisit the project, but I 
learnt a lot which was my main aim.
